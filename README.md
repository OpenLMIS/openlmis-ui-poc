This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

## Project Overview

This project is the **Proof of Concept** for the new UI of the **LMIS** (Logistics Management Information System) app. It is structured to utilize React, TypeScript, and Vite for a modern web application. The current version is **0.0.1**.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm run dev`: Starts the development server using Vite.
- `npm run build`: Compiles the TypeScript files and builds the project for production.
- `npm run lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code quality issues.
- `npm run preview`: Previews the production build.

## Dependencies

This project includes several dependencies to enhance functionality:

- **React and React DOM**: Core libraries for building user interfaces.
- **Radix UI**: A set of accessible UI components.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Shadcn/ui**: A collection of UI components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS, providing a consistent design system.
- **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state management solution for React applications.
- **TanStack Router**: A powerful routing library for React that provides a flexible and type-safe way to manage navigation and data fetching.

```plaintext
VITE_API_BASE_URL=
VITE_FE_PORT=
VITE_AUTH_SERVER_CLIENT_ID=
VITE_AUTH_SERVER_CLIENT_SECRET=
```
